### Introduction

With the ever increasing amount of information on the web, users are loaded with information. They face the challenge of 
finding the most relevant and useful information on the internet. Recommendation systems have emerged as one of the solution 
to this problem of huge data flood.

In general, recommendation systems rely on user modeling approaches to approximate user preferences and build user profiles based on 
users' purchase history, item ratings etc. Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommendation are the standard 
techniques of recommendation used in the industry. However, standard recommendation systems suffer from many 
problems:
* Cold Start Problem - when a new user starts using the system
* First Rater Problem - when a new item is introduced

**Cross Domain Recommender Systems** are one of the newer techniques used to alleviate cold-start problem.
The main idea is to use rating information accumulated in one domain (source domain) to improve the quality of recommendations
in another domain (target domain).

### Dataset
For the purpose of this project, we used two datasets:
* MovieLens-100k 
* Yelp Challenge Dataset

#### MovieLens-100k
First, we performed some data exploration on the movie lens dataset. Here are the plots:
