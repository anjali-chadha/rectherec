### Introduction

With the ever increasing amount of information on the web, users are loaded with information. They face the challenge of 
finding the most relevant and useful information on the internet. Recommendation systems have emerged as one of the solution 
to this problem of huge data flood.

In general, recommendation systems rely on user modeling approaches to approximate user preferences and build user profiles based on 
users' purchase history, item ratings etc. Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommendation are the standard 
techniques of recommendation used in the industry. However, standard recommendation systems suffer from many 
problems:
* Cold Start Problem - when a new user starts using the system
* First Rater Problem - when a new item is introduced

**Cross Domain Recommender Systems** are one of the newer techniques used to alleviate cold-start problem.
The main idea is to use rating information accumulated in one domain (source domain) to improve the quality of recommendations
in another domain (target domain).

### Dataset
For the purpose of this project, we used two datasets:
* MovieLens-100k 
* Yelp Challenge Dataset

#### MovieLens-100k
First, we performed some data exploration on the movie lens dataset. Here are the plots:

### Related Work
Literature Survey of cross domain recommender systems:

**Cross Domain Collaborative Filtering**
<br>Collaborative Filtering boils down to analyzing the user-item matrix. It can be easily extended with other auxiliary domains under the pretext of common users or common items. 1,2,3
	
**Content Based Cross Domain Recommendations**
<br>Content based CDR models users and items as feature vectors and recommends based on similarity between the two. If users/items are common among different domains the feature vectors can simply be concatenated to incorporate more information. 4

**Neural Network based CDRs**
* Multi-View Deep Neural Network -
<br>Content based techniques calculates features to represent users and items. Neural networks are powerful feature extractors and can be effectively used in a multi/cross domain setting. 5,6
* CCCFNet (Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering)
<br>Content-based modelling of MV-DNN is used to augement the Collaborative Filtering matrix. The idea is to the correlate the latent-factor matrix of the CF part with the content-modelling of MV-DNN. 7

In all the above explained methods either there is single or mutiple cross domains. However, there is very little analysis on which domains can help the prediction in the target domain the most. A gap that we seek to fill. 

### Proposed Solution

### Results
We test a bunch of simple baselines such as SVD, Biased-Matrix Factorisation and CCCFNet. 
* MovieLens Dataset:- 

For CCCFNet, to simulate 2 independent domains we split the utility matrix of movieLens dataset. The performance of the different methods is compared based on the RMSE values. CCCFNet always beats the simpler baseline methods and hence establishes that it is a better technique by the virtue of using a hybrid Content and CF method.

* Yelp Dataset:- 

We evaluated 2 different source domains for one target domain.

1. *Source Domain* - Food
2. *Target Domain*- Restaurant

1. *Source Domain* - Shopping
2. *Target Domain* - Restaurant

The idea was to see if there is a appreciable increase the recommendation performance in one of the configurations. Ideally, the food-restaurant recommendation should perform better than shopping-restaurant since the domains are correlated. 

We measure the recommendation performance using the RMSE.
